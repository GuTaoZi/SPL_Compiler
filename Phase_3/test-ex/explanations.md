#### test_12111624_1.spl

This program calculates the fibonacci series with matrix acceleration. The time complexity is $O(log N)$ and the space complexity is $O(1)$.

This program contains bonus features like structure variables in parameters and multi-dimensional arrays as local variables.

#### test_12111624_2.spl

This program is a DFS-based maze solver, outputing 1 if the maze is solvable otherwise 0. The recursive solver function accepts a structure with 2D array member as parameter.

#### test_12111624_3.spl

This program is a simple sample showing the feature of `continue` and `break` keywords.

#### test_12111624_4.spl

This program is an example of Gaussian elimination, containing a function with a 2D matrix as the parameter.

#### test_12111624_5.spl

This program is an example showing local scope shadowing. An inner array has the same name as the outer array, accessing inside/outside the block with the same name corresponds to accessing inner/outer array.
